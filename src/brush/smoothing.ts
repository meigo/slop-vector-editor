/**
 * Stroke steadying (pure).
 * Ported from slop-paint src/stroke-smoothing.ts and src/input.ts (2026-09-29) — carry fixes both ways.
 *
 * Stream is a ROPE (a "lazy brush"): the line is pulled behind the pen on a string of
 * `ropeLength` screen px, so movement shorter than the string never reaches it. It works in
 * screen space, so it feels the same at any zoom and on any pointer rate (a per-event average
 * weakened as events got faster — a Pencil's 240 Hz left most of the wobble).
 *
 * Smooth averages each point of the Smooth brush's path with its neighbours BOTH sides, by arc
 * length. The brush redraws the whole stroke every frame, so this costs no lag; the window
 * narrows toward the ends, so a stroke still starts and ends exactly where it was drawn (the tip
 * settles as the stroke grows past it).
 *
 * Both keep a CORNER where the pen pauses: a pen held nearly still for `PAUSE_MS` pulls the rope
 * in along a smooth curve from the line to the pen (`catchUpPath`) — a straight pull cut across a curve — so the line
 * reaches the corner before setting off again (a lift catches up the same way), and the path is
 * smoothed leg by leg between pauses (`pauseBreaks`) when Sharp corners is on, so the averaging
 * never spans the corner (off by default: the rounded corner is a look people like).
 * A turn made without stopping still rounds.
