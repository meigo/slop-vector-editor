## 2026-09-16 — Milestone 1: scaffold, model, render, files

- Project scaffold copied from slop-animator's toolchain (Svelte 5 runes, TS strict, Vite 8,
  Tailwind 4 with the SLOP-TIMELINE-UI palette, Vitest, ESLint/Prettier, husky, wrangler).
- Immutable document model; pure undo session with gesture support; `app` store with `$state.raw`.
- Own XML reader (runs in node for tests), SVG path-data reader/writer with arcs and quadratics,
  CSS colors, transform lists, serializer and importer. Own files round-trip exactly (6-decimal
  rounding); Inkscape/Figma/Illustrator-shaped fixtures import with a dropped-feature report.
- The importer rejects non-finite numbers and invalid/oversized artboards, falling back to
  `width`/`height`, then 300×150, and reporting "invalid artboard size"; a transform list
  containing any unknown function is ignored as a whole (identity), not applied partially.
- Canvas renders through the exporter's attribute functions; pan (drag/wheel), zoom
  (ctrl-wheel, Safari gesture events, two-finger pinch), fit on load/replace.
- File menu: New (presets), Open, Save, Save As, Document settings; in-app confirm; notices;
  keyboard shortcuts; IndexedDB autosave (SVG text) with restore. Autosave is skipped for the
  rest of the session (one notice only) when IndexedDB is unavailable.
- Plan: `docs/superpowers/plans/2026-09-16-m1-scaffold-model-files.md`.
- Browser-verified (desktop Chrome): fitted artboard on load; Inkscape/Figma/Illustrator
  fixtures render with correct dropped-feature notices (hidden layer not drawn); mouse drag
  pan; wheel pan; ctrl+wheel zoom (×e, preventDefault true); ⌘0 fit, ⌘1 100%; menu → Document
  settings → 400×297 + background → dirty dot + undo enabled; ⌘Z/⇧⌘Z; open-while-dirty shows
  in-app confirm, Cancel keeps doc; invalid file → error notice, doc unchanged;
  serialize→open→serialize byte-identical; New 512×512 clean + fitted; autosave restores dirty
  doc (name + dot) and clean doc after reload; no console errors on load.
- Owed: real OS file picker / save-in-place / download fallback (automation can't drive OS
  dialogs); resize-without-refit; Safari trackpad gesture events; touch pinch/pan; iPad.

## 2026-09-16 — final review fixes

- F1: `ParseResult` gained `native` (true only when the root `<svg>` has `data-sv-version`).
  `openText` keeps the File System Access handle only when the file is native and nothing was
  dropped, so ⌘S on a foreign file goes through the save picker/download fallback instead of
  overwriting the original; the info notice says so when a handle is discarded.
- F2: `autosave.ts` exports `flushAutosave()`, which performs the pending debounced write
  immediately (same error reporting) instead of waiting out the 3 s timer. `App.svelte` calls it
  on `document` `visibilitychange` (hidden) and `window` `pagehide` while autosave is enabled, so
  closing the tab or switching apps no longer drops the last few seconds of edits.
- F3: `parse.ts` exports `MAX_COORD = 1e9`; `num`/`numbers` reject values beyond it like
  non-finite ones. `transform.ts` and `pathdata.ts` each keep a local copy of the same bound (to
  avoid an import cycle with `parse.ts`) so an overflowing composed transform falls back to
  identity and an overflowing path coordinate stops the path, instead of `fmt` writing "Infinity"
  back out on save.
- F4: `xml.ts`'s `decode` now throws `XmlError` for numeric character references to code points
  XML 1.0 forbids (nulls, most C0 controls, the UTF-16 surrogates, U+FFFE/U+FFFF).
  `serialize.ts`'s `escapeAttr` writes tab/LF/CR as `&#9;`/`&#10;`/`&#13;` and strips any other C0
  control character, so a name or value containing one still round-trips as well-formed XML.
- F5: `autosave.ts`'s `writeAutosave` now resolves on the write transaction's `oncomplete` and
  rejects on `onabort`/`onerror` (`tx.error`), rather than on the `put` request's `onsuccess` —
  the previous version could report success before the write was durable.
